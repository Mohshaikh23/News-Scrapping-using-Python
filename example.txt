Teenagers have been learning the music technology skills needed to put on professional shows.At The Gather in Ennerdale Bridge, Cumbria, a group have been taking part in a series of workshops funded by Arts Council England.The sessions equip them with the skills to polish the vocals and smooth the instrumental sounds of touring musicians.The scheme is the brainchild of retired headteacher, Peter Maher, who hopes it will improve the technical skills of those involved and provide some real-life experience.Mr Maher, who organised the workshop project in the west Cumbrian village, says he "knows of no other project like this"."It brings them in on day one at the level of novice, and by day five they’re equipped to fully manage the technical side of a performance," he added.Youngsters like theatre-mad, 17-year-old Niamh McMullin from Cockermouth spent the week preparing for a full live show by musicians Snake Davis and Gareth Moulton.Miss McMullin said the project had been "a steep learning curve"."I think I was thrown in a bit at the deep end because I’m not really from a technical or a musical background," she said."I've always been interested in theatre and this is an extension of that."Meanwhile, 15-year-old Samuel Wrightson, from Carlisle, said he was keen to develop the skills needed to work in the music industry."I just thought it would be a great opportunity to learn about the new systems and I haven't been able to do that before and I always love to do stuff like this," he said.They were supervised by students already on music production, or similar, courses.The group worked together to prepare for a final night gig at The Gather which was streamed live to online viewers across the world.Saxophonist Snake Davis said he was always keen to help young people make their way in music."These youngsters are potentially going to follow in our footsteps and look for employment within the industry," Mr Davis said."To get an experience of real life, because this not a pretend gig, this is a proper gig and they’re sorting it out, is so valuable."For 14-year-old Daniel Bishop, it has been "the perfect week".“It’s very exciting. I just feel quite privileged to be with such great people.”
