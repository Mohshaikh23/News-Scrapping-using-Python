3,20-Aug-24,The mind-bending mirrors behind advanced technology,"Huge, tiny or incredibly flat, advanced mirrors are essential to high-tech machines.",Europe,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/51ca/live/6949ec50-3dd7-11ef-9e1c-3b4a473456a6.jpg.webp,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1646ewzleo,"High on a mountain, in Chile's bone dry Atacama desert the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is currently building the world's largest optical telescope.No time was wasted on choosing a name -  it will be called the Extremely Large Telescope or ELT.Instead, huge energy has gone into designing and building “the world’s biggest eye on the sky”, which should start collecting images in 2028 and is very likely to expand our understanding of the universe.None of that would be possible without some of the most advanced mirrors ever made.Dr Elise Vernet is an adaptive optics specialist at ESO and has been overseeing development of the five giant mirrors that will gather and channel light to the telescope’s measuring equipment.Each of the ELT’s custom mirrors is a feat of optical design.Dr Vernet describes the 14ft (4.25m) convex M2 mirror as “a piece of art”.But perhaps the M1 and M4 mirrors best express the level of intricacy and precision required.The primary mirror, M1, is the largest mirror ever made for an optical telescope.“It’s 39m [128ft] in diameter, made up of [798] hexagonal mirror segments, aligned so that it behaves as a perfect monolithic mirror,” says Dr Vernet.M1 will collect 100 million times more light than the human eye and must be able to maintain position and shape to a level of precision 10,000 times finer than a human hair.The M4 is the largest deformable mirror ever made and will be able to change shape 1,000 times per second to correct for atmospheric turbulence and the vibrations of the telescope itself that could otherwise distort imagery.Its flexible surface is made up of six petals of a glass-ceramic material that is less than 2mm (0.075in) thick.The petals were made by Schott in Mainz, Germany and then shipped to engineering firm Safran Reosc just outside Paris, where they were polished and assembled into the complete mirror.All five mirrors are nearing completion and will soon be transported to Chile for installation.While these enormous mirrors will be used to capture the light of the cosmos, ESO’s neighbours in Garching, at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics, have created a quantum mirror to operate at the tiniest scales imaginable.In 2020, a research team was able to make a single layer of 200 aligned atoms behave collectively to reflect light, effectively creating a mirror so small it cannot be seen by the naked eye. In 2023, they succeeded in placing a single microscopically controlled atom at the centre of the array to create a “quantum switch” that can be used to control whether the atoms are transparent or reflective.“What theorists predicted, and we observed this experimentally, is that in these ordered structures, once you absorb a photon and it gets re-emitted, it's actually emitted [in one predictable] direction and this is what makes it a mirror,” says Dr Pascal Weckesser, a postdoctoral researcher at the institute.This ability to control the direction of atom-reflected light could have future applications in a number of quantum technologies like, for example, hack-proof quantum networks for storing and transmitting information.Further north-west in Oberkochen near Stuttgart, mirrors with another extreme property are being made by Zeiss.The optics company spent years developing an ultra-flat mirror which has become a key component in the machines which print computer chips, called extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, or EUVs.Dutch company ASML is the world's leading maker of EUVs, and Zeiss mirrors are an essential component of them.Zeiss’s EUV mirrors can reflect light at very small wavelengths which enables image clarity at a tiny scale, so more and more transistors can be printed on the same area of silicon wafer.To explain how flat the mirrors are, Dr Frank Rohmund, president of semiconductor manufacturing optics at Zeiss, uses a topographical analogy.“If you took a household mirror and blew it up to the size of Germany, the highest elevation point would be 5m. On a space mirror [as in the James Webb Space Telescope], it would be 2cm [0.75in]. On an EUV mirror, it would be 0.1mm,” he explains.This ultra-smooth mirror surface combined with systems that control the mirror’s positioning, also made by Zeiss, yield an accuracy level equivalent to bouncing light off an EUV mirror on the Earth’s surface and picking out a golf ball on the moon.While those mirrors may already sound extreme, Zeiss has plans for improvement, to help make even more powerful computer chips.“We have ideas about how to develop EUV further. By 2030, the goal is to have a microchip with one trillion transistors on it. Today, we are maybe at a hundred billion.”That goal came closer with Zeiss's latest tech, which enables the printing of about three times more structures on the same area than the current generation of chip making machines.“The semiconductor industry has this dominating strong roadmap which provides a drumbeat for all players contributing to the solution. With this, we are able to provide progress in terms of microchip fabrication which today allows things like artificial intelligence which were unthinkable even ten years ago,” says Dr Rohmund.What humanity will understand and be capable of in ten years’ time remains to be seen, but mirrors will no doubt be at the heart of the technologies that take us there."

5,01-Aug-24,Can technology fix the 'broken' concert ticketing system?,The increased use of AI may prevent tickets being resold at excessively high prices.,Wales,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4f57/live/21801850-4a65-11ef-935f-59cf6f181f38.jpg.webp,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cml2p8nvzp9o,"For Nashville native Jacki Thrapp flying to Europe this summer to see her idol Taylor Swift perform live was a “no brainer”.With the cheapest tickets for the remaining US dates of Swift’s continuing Eras Tour now costing $2,500 (£2,000) on the resale market, up from their face value of $49, some American fans realised that it would be cheaper for them to fly across the Atlantic to catch one of the European shows instead.So back in May, Jacki went to see Swift perform twice in Sweden, with each ticket costing her less than $200.“Americans are paying so much money, and a lot of Taylor Swift fans are people in their 20s and 30s,” says the 32-year-old. “We're paying so much money to see her in the US when a lot of us still can't even afford a house.”Although Jacki bought two Swedish tickets on the secondary market, the mark-up of the most expensive was only around double its face value. This is said to be because buying resold tickets is not an established thing to do in Sweden, unlike in the US and UK.In other European countries, such as Germany, tickets cannot be resold at more than 25% above their face value. Meanwhile, some nations go even further. Italy, Portugal and the Republic of Ireland all have laws in place that prevent concert tickets being sold above their original price.In the UK and the US the price of re-sold tickets can currently be as high as people are willing to pay. In April, 250 musical artists, including Billie Eilish and Cyndi Lauper, signed an open letter that attacked ""predatory resellers"", and called the current ticking system ""broken"".The situation may change for the better in the UK in the next few years, as the Labour Party, which forms the new government, said in March that it planned to cap the resale price of tickets.Yet laws preventing excessive pricing on the secondary market do not stop two key issues – touts getting their hands on excessive amounts of tickets in the first instance, and the risk of people buying counterfeit tickets or being scammed.The latter is said to have affected hundreds of Taylor Swift fans who tried to buy tickets for her concerts in the UK this summer.Asher Weiss, chief executive of ticketing start-up Tixologi, believes that technology is the solution, particularly AI.“People [touts] will buy a ticket and list it on multiple marketplaces for secondary sale,” he says. “And then even if it sells on one, they won't take it down off the other one.“So multiple people end up with the same ticket, trying to get in,” explains Mr Weiss, whose firm is based in Los Angeles.To prevent people buying excessive numbers of tickets, he says that Tixologi’s AI “will be able to flag people making multiple purchases from the same IP address as unusual purchasing behaviour”.“That would prevent those bad actors, and protect the true fans and customers,” adds Mr Weiss.His firm is also able to ensure that only one copy of a ticket can ever exist. It does this by using blockchain, the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies. This prevents duplication.Tixologi’s electronic tickets also have a rotating QR code that is said to be extremely difficult to copy, so that fake ones are instantly spotted when scanned. And a venue or artist can select a function called “disable transfers”, which prevents a user from emailing the ticket to someone else. This makes them much harder to re-sell.UK ticketing company Seat Unique is working with London’s Wembley Stadium to sell hospitality tickets for Taylor Swift’s tour. She returns to the stadium for five shows in August, following three there in June.“It is probably the most popular event I’ve seen in 15 years,” says Robin Sherry, Seat Unique’s founder and chief executive.The company specializes in allowing venues and artists to sell their tickets via dynamic pricing. What this means is that the price is allowed to go up, and down, according to demand.The idea is that the venue and artists sell the tickets directly, and therefore get the additional income if prices rise, instead of that money going to sellers on the secondary market.To set the dynamic price Seat Unique is now using AI to constantly monitor demand and automatically respond to it.“It’s ultimately about keeping tickets in the hands of fans not scalpers,” says Mr Sherry, who also works with sports clubs and organisations.He adds that AI also has the ability to transform the marketing of concerts and other events, with adverts specifically targeted at individuals based on learning what they are interested in.“I always jokingly say, AI will know what events you want to go to before I do,” he adds, saying that this will be “revolutionary in an industry that has been slow to modernise”.While AI is starting to change how we are able buy tickets to concerts and other events, it is also beginning to appear on the stage.In November a new AI-powered hologram of Elvis Presley will be performing live in London.The creator of the Elvis Evolution production, Andrew McGuiness, says the hologram is so lifelike that it will be “less like Abba Voyage and more like time travel”.But whether AI will be the answer for fans like Jacki Thrapp remains to be seen. ""This was the first time I've ever left America to see one of my favourite artists, but there has to be a better way to do this,” she says.Both Seat Unique and Tixologi hope that better way will be delivered by advances in AI."

Its ULTRA (Uncrewed Low-cost Transport), is a self-flying aircraft designed to carry 100kg packages over 600km (372 miles). The company's aircrafts first flew in 2019 to transport medical supplies to the Isle of Wight. Since then, Windracers have taken post and parcels to remote islands in Orkney and the Shetlands.A number of its drones can also be spotted flying around the company test centre in Llanbedr, Gwynedd. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Mr Muderack said the company hopes to manufacture on a larger scale in future.""Drones can make such a difference to people's lives – especially those living in rural areas of Wales,"" he said. ""The uses for the platform are infinite. Over time this platform could fly anywhere in the world.""  Windracers has worked with organisations including the Ministry, British Antarctic Survey and Royal Mail.Research is still in the test phase but they are confident that with more trails, delivery via aviation could really ""take off"". ""A key barrier to the plan will be regulating and managing the sky."" said Mr Muderack. ""We want to gather more data, working with a regulator, to see how far we can take this."" There is increasing interest in aircraft delivery, as the first commercial drone mail service in Orkney was recently extended to 2026 to take letters and parcels between islands."

Distractions and not wearing seatbelts were ""key factors"" in crashes, it added. TfGM said drivers were four times more likely to be in a crash if they use their phone while driving and twice as likely to die in a crash if they do not wear a seat belt.Introduction of the AI cameras follows Safer Roads Greater Manchester's Touch.Screen campaign which aimed to raise awareness of the dangers of using a mobile phone at the wheel. The campaign was supported by Calvin Buckley, whose partner Frankie Jules-Hough and their unborn daughter died after a driver, who filmed himself speeding on the M66 in Bury, crashed into their car.Mr Buckley said his ""life was destroyed"" as a result of someone using their phone while driving.“It’s become quite common for people to use their phone to check messages, send photos or change the music while driving,"" he said. “But all it takes is a split second to become distracted, and when you take your eyes off the road anything could happen.""Heads Up, which can be mounted to a vehicle or a trailer, has been used by police forces and local highways authorities across the UK since it was first trialled by National Highways in 2021.Greater Manchester Police is one of the ten forces now joining the trial.

9,7 days ago,Have supermarkets reached peak self-scan?,Supermarkets are beginning to question the divisive technology after years of criticism from shoppers.,Hull & East Yorkshire,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2751/live/03dffa70-5ed5-11ef-8946-5dee0275025b.jpg.webp,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj08m35q3l9o,"After years of encouraging shoppers to scan their own groceries, some supermarkets are checking out a move back to traditional tills.Asda said it would put more staff on checkouts, while Morrisons admitted it might have ""gone too far"" with self-scan. Northern upmarket chain Booths has got rid of them altogether.The dreaded ""unexpected item in the bagging area"" announcement is among a list of customer complaints about self-service tills.But some shoppers told the BBC they're happy to skip the queues and the chit chat if it speeds up their shop.The debate over staffed versus unstaffed tills has continued to rumble on as the number of self-scan tills has increased over the past 20 years to some 80,000 in the UK.Now Morrisons chief executive has claimed the store ""went a bit too far"" with the self-checkout. Although they drive some productivity, ""some shoppers dislike it, mainly when they have a full trolley,"" Rami Baitiéh, told the Telegraph.He said the chain was now ""reviewing"" its number of self-service checkouts, with plans to remove some in favour of staffed tills.His comments came after Asda pledged to put more staff on checkouts after admitting it had reached a limit with self-service tills.Some have gone further. Booths - a smaller, upmarket supermarket chain based in the north of England - rid itself of the technology completely last November.For Beverley Hyrb, from Oldham in Greater Manchester there's a new nuisance when it comes to negotiating the self-scan. She is particularly turned off by the cameras on some of these tills that capture live footage of the user.""You see an image of yourself moving about and I don’t like it,"" the 62-year-old said. ""I’d rather get in a queue.""Stores could be using the technology to discourage shoplifting, after such cases in England and Wales hit the highest level for 20 years in April.Ms Hyrb added that there were mental health benefits to speaking to someone when grocery shopping.""Especially if you’re living on your own. Doesn’t matter if it’s about the weather or the news or whatever, it’s just good to chat.""For others self-checkouts are not merely annoying, but a challenge to use.""As a deaf person, I can't hear the beep when I scan items so I'm always getting in a tangle with them as they don't always scan correctly,"" said Anna Kenyon from Manchester.She said people - as opposed to machines - are much better at adapting to her condition. Like Beverley, she appreciates the human touch.""I've had some lovely interactions in Aldi where a checkout assistant spontaneously started signing with me. Little moments of connection like that are lovely.”Julie Yates has two adult sons who have autism and said self-checkouts allow them some independence.""They don't have to interact with anyone, they can be in and out and gone,"" she said. ""They don't have to make eye contact or small talk.""""My mum and I, we go to a [staffed] checkout,"" Ms Yates said. ""It's a little social interaction, it can be a nice part of the day.""Others simply prefer self-checkout because they find it quicker.For 74-year-old Trevor Springford from Dunbar in East Lothian ""it's all about getting in and out fast without having to queue, get involved in a conversation or field questions.""For people like Trevor, it is welcome news that self-checkouts won't be going away entirely anytime soon. As for those who loathe them, they may start to see a few more staffed tills in future.The British Retail Consortium which represents most of the UK's major supermarkets would not be drawn on whether this was the start of a phasing out of self-scan. A spokesperson told BBC News: ""Retailers will adapt check-out systems across their different stores to meet the diverse needs of their customers.""Ged Futter, director of supermarket consultancy The Retail Mind, agreed that customer feedback is king when it comes to these kinds of shifts in retail.""At the moment, I think it's particular to those two retailers [Asda and Morrisons],"" he told BBC Breakfast. One of the benefits self-scans bring to supermarkets is they cut staff wage bills, but if it impacts on customer experience, it's bad for business.""The retailers themselves will always be looking at costs, [but] sometimes when you're looking at costs, you can go too far,"" Mr Futter said.""Successful retailing is all based on feedback from the customer. It's about understanding your customer,"" he added.BBC News contacted all the UK's major supermarket chains to ask whether they were changing their till set-up. Tesco, Lidl, Co-Op and Waitrose said they would continue to offer both.Marks and Spencer said their stores had different formats for different customer needs, but all stores with staffed tills always has at least one open for checkout.Aldi and Sainsbury's did not respond to requests for comment.Tesco said it introduced self-checkout tills nearly 20 years ago. A spokesperson for the country's biggest supermarket said: ""We are proud to offer customers choice when it comes to checking out and customers can always ask a colleague for a manned till to be opened.""But Fazilet Hadi, head of policy at Disability Rights UK, said customers should not have to ask for a staffed till to be opened. ""They're not always that visible, these staff. What if I can't see them?""However she acknowledged that reasonable adjustments for people with disabilities ""have to be proportionate"".""What's reasonable for a multi-million pound chain may not be reasonable for a corner shop,"" she said, but added that choice was important as everyone's needs are different.Mel Merritt, head of policy and campaigns at the National Autistic Society, said some people ""may prefer the reduced level of social communication and interaction which a self-service checkout provides"".""Others may need more support while shopping and may benefit from having staff at checkouts who can help,"" she added."

The system has been fitted on four of the six Linacs at the Queen’s Centre and will be rolled out to the remaining two machines in the coming months, the NHS said. It added appointment times were likely to be reduced because of the efficiency of the new SGRT system.Follow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

16,3 days ago,Ukraine's long-range drones using Western tech to hit Russia,Western technology and finance are helping Ukraine carry out hundreds of long-range strikes inside Russia.,Business,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1a04/live/e1c81760-655f-11ef-9851-c5606b77a2fd.png.webp,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6240qepyppo,"Western technology and finance are helping Ukraine carry out hundreds of long-range strikes inside Russia.That is despite Nato allies still refusing to give Ukraine permission to use Western-supplied munitions to do so – mostly because of fears of escalation.Ukraine has been stepping up its long-range strikes inside Russia over the past few months, launching scores of drones simultaneously at strategic targets several times a week. The targets include air force bases, oil and ammunition depots and command centres.Ukrainian firms are now producing hundreds of armed one-way attack drones a month, at a fraction of the cost it takes to produce a similar drone in the West. One company told the BBC it was already creating a disproportionate impact on Russia’s war economy at a relatively small expense.The BBC has been briefed by a number of those involved in these missions. They include one of Ukraine’s largest one-way attack drone manufacturers, as well as a big data company which has helped develop software for Ukraine to carry out these strikes.Francisco Serra-Martins says the strategy is already creating huge dilemmas for Moscow. He believes that with extra investment, it will turn the tide of the war in Ukraine’s favour.Eighteen months ago, the company he co-founded, Terminal Autonomy, didn’t even exist. It is now producing more than a hundred AQ400 Scythe long-range drones a month, with a range of 750km (465 miles). The company also makes hundreds of  shorter range AQ100 Bayonet drones a month, which can fly a few hundred kilometres.The drones are made of wood and are being assembled in former furniture factories in Ukraine.Mr Serra-Martins, a former Australian Army Royal Engineer, set up the company with his Ukrainian co-founder, backed by US finance. It is one of at least three companies now producing drones in Ukraine at scale.He describes his drones as “basically flying furniture – we assemble it like Ikea”.It takes about an hour to build the fuselage and half that time to put the brains inside it – the electronics, motor and explosives.The company’s Bayonet drone costs a few thousand dollars. In contrast, a Russian air defence missile used to shoot it down can cost more than $1m.     It is not only cheap drones making the difference. Palantir, a large US data analysis company,  was one of the first Western tech companies to aid Ukraine’s war effort. It started by providing software to improve the speed and accuracy of its artillery strikes. Now it has given Ukraine new tools  to plan its long-range drone strikes.British engineers from Palantir, working with Ukrainian counterparts, have designed a programme to generate and map the best ways to reach a target. Palantir makes clear it is not involved in the missions, but has helped train more than 1,000 Ukrainians how to use its software.The BBC has been shown how it works in principle. Using streams of data, it can map Russia’s air defences, radar and electronic jammers. The end product looks similar to a topographical chart.The tighter the contours, the heavier the air defences. The locations have already  been identified by Ukraine using commercial satellite imagery and signals intelligence.Louis Mosley of Palantir says the programme is helping Ukraine to skirt around Russia’s electronic warfare and air defence systems to reach their target.“Understanding and visualising what that looks like across the entire battle space is really critical to optimising these missions,” he says.The execution of the long-range drone strikes is being co-ordinated by Ukraine’s intelligence agencies, who work in secrecy. But the BBC has been told by other sources about some of the detail.  Scores of drones can be fired for any one mission – as many as 60 at one target.The attacks are mostly carried out at night. Most will be shot down. As few as 10% may reach the target. Some drones are even shot down along the way by friendly fire - Ukraine’s own air defences.Ukraine has had to work out ways to counter Russian electronic jamming. Terminal Autonomy’s Scythe drone uses visual positioning – navigating its course and examining the terrain by Artificial Intelligence. There is no pilot involved.Palantir software will have already mapped the best routes. Mr Serra-Martins says flying a lot of drones is key to overwhelming and exhausting Russia’s air defences.  So too is making the drones cheaper than the missiles trying to shoot them down, or the targets they are trying to hit.Prof Justin Bronk of the Royal United Services Institute says Ukraine’s long-range drone attacks  are creating dilemmas for Moscow. Although Russia has a lot of air defences, it still cannot protect everything.Prof Bronk says Ukraine’s long-range strikes are showing ordinary Russians that “the state can’t defend them fully and that Russia is vulnerable”. Ukrainian drones have been spotted more than 1,000km (620 miles) inside Russia. They have been shot down over Moscow. But the focus has been on military sites. The map below highlights just a handful of the dozen targets hit over the past few months. They include five Russian airbases.Prof Justin Bronk says targeting Russian airbases has so far been the only effective way Ukraine has to respond to Russia’s glide bombs. It has forced Russia to move aircraft to bases further away and reduce the frequency of their attacks. Satellite imagery shows how Ukrainian drones have successfully damaged hangars at its Marinovka airbase.Ukraine clearly believes it could do even more with the help of Western-made long-range weapons. But so far, allies have rejected Kyiv’s pleas. There is still a lingering fear, especially in Washington and Berlin, that it could drag the West further into the conflict. But that hasn’t stopped Western companies and finance from helping Ukraine.Ukraine is still largely having to rely on its home-grown efforts, convinced that bringing the war to Russia is a key to winning this war.Francisco Serra-Martins also believes Western manufacturers are still “woefully unprepared” to fight high-intensity warfare – producing far fewer long-range weapons at a much higher cost. He says what Ukraine really needs now “is a lot of good enough systems”. The BBC has talked to one Ukrainian company which is already developing a new cruise missile, at least 10 times cheaper than a British-made Storm Shadow missile. Despite the West’s misgivings, Ukraine is planning to step up its attacks on Russia. Mr Serra-Martins says: “What you’re seeing now is like nothing compared to what you’ll see by the end of the year."""

Their thoughts are with everyone affected by the tragedy,"" they said.Andrew Kanter, a close friend and colleague of Mr Lynch, said he was “the most brilliant mind and caring person I have ever known.”“Over nearly a quarter century I had the privilege of working beside someone unrivalled in their understanding of technology and business,” he said.Former Sun newspaper editor David Yelland said Mr Lynch was ""an irreplaceable loss not only to those that loved him but also to the country"".""He is the UK's greatest tech entrepreneur of recent decades, a family man, a long-time client of my business and a friend,"" he said.""To think Mike Lynch lost his life just as he began to rebuild it is devastating for all those that know him.""Morgan Stanley International bank chairman Jonathan Bloomer, his wife Judy Bloomer, Clifford Chance lawyer Chris Morvillo, his wife Neda Morvillo and Recaldo Thomas, the yacht's chef, also died when the vessel sank.In a statement confirming their parents' deaths, the Bloomer family described the couple as ""incredible people and an inspiration to many"".Mr Lynch is survived by his wife Angela Bacares, who was rescued, along with 14 others, after the yacht sank, as well as their elder daughter Esme. Mike Lynch and Angela Barcares lived at the Loudham Hall estate in Suffolk.Brent Hoberman, co-founder of Lastminute.com, described the events as ""tragic"", saying Mr Lynch had much more to give to the UK tech scene.""He was still on his journey, and he’d been sidetracked for a decade with this court case,"" he told the BBC.""I think there was a lot of unfulfilled potential.""IT analyst Richard Holway said in a post on LinkedIn that Mr Lynch - a friend of more than 25 years - was ""a unique British tech talent"". ""Goodness knows what he could have achieved next,"" he added.Mr Lynch co-founded tech firm Autonomy in 1996, which expanded rapidly and was sold to Hewlett Packard for $11bn (£8.6bn) in 2011, from which he is believed to have netted £500m.But questions over the sale of Autonomy led to a long-running legal battle.In 2022, Mr Lynch lost a civil fraud case against HP at the High Court in London.A day later, he was extradited to the US as part of criminal proceedings, and was facing a possible two decades in jail.He was acquitted in June this year after a jury found him not guilty of the crimes.He told BBC Radio 4 that though he was convinced of his innocence, he was only able to prove it in a US court because he was rich enough to pay the enormous legal fees involved.Mr Lynch is reported to have gone on the yacht trip with his family to celebrate securing his freedom.Its name, Bayesian, is understood to derive from the theory that his PhD thesis - and the software that underpinned Autonomy - was based on.Witnesses say its aluminium mast broke in half in a storm, causing the ship to lose its balance and sink.Dick Smith, a neighbour of Mr Lynch, told the BBC he was ""reeling from the shock of the news"".""He was so approachable and a very easy person to talk to with a nice sense of humour,"" he said.""You might think with all that money he would be difficult to talk to, but in fact he was a very easy person to talk to.""Born on 16 June 1965, Mr Lynch was the son of a nurse and a fireman, and was raised near Chelmsford in Essex.His first computer was a BBC Micro, and he wrote fondly of how it shaped his passion for programming in a 2011 BBC article celebrating 30 years of the device.While at school his ""first foray into commercialisation of technology"" came when designing a digital sampler that could sample music, then selling the designs, according to a 2017 interview.He continued the hobby while studying Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge - where he said he annoyed his college by getting ""solder in the carpets"" of his room.While at Cambridge he earned a PhD in mathematical computing, and later undertook a research fellowship.In 1991, Mr Lynch helped establish Cambridge Neurodynamics - a firm which specialised in using computer-based detection and recognition of fingerprints.His tech firm Autonomy was created five years later, using a statistical method known as ""Bayesian inference"" at the core of its software.The company's fast-paced growth and success throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s saw Mr Lynch earn a number of awards and accolades.In 2006 he was awarded an OBE in recognition of his service to UK enterprise.He served on the board of the BBC as a non-executive director, and in 2011 was appointed to the government's council for science and technology - advising then-Prime Minister David Cameron on the risks and possibilities of AI development.Following the sale of Autonomy, Mr Lynch established tech firm Invoke Capital, which helped create prominent UK cybersecurity firm Darktrace in 2013. Lynch had a seat on its board until earlier this year.Reacting to the news on Thursday, a spokesperson for Darktrace said that they were shocked by the tragedy, describing Mr Lynch as an ""active champion"" of the UK's technology sector.""His loss will be felt by many,"" they added."

Once they have given their fingerprints and details, that registration will be valid for three years.During that time it must be validated every time someone crosses the border. This will replace passport-stamping.In most cases the EES checks will happen when you arrive at an international airport but if you're travelling via the Port of Dover or an international train then the checks will take place in the UK.The technology that ports will use to take biometric data of travellers has not yet been confirmed.It was previously suggested that a gadget similar to an iPad could be used to take fingerprints. The EES was originally meant to begin in 2022 but it has faced many setbacks.It had previously been rescheduled for May 2023, then the end of 2023, and now is expected to come into force in November 2024.Lilian Greenwood, Future of Roads Minister, said the government had been reviewing the EES plans to ensure ""registration can be smooth and queue times kept to a minimum"".""Nobody wants to see excessive queues at our ports, which is why we’re providing this funding to ensure our borders are as prepared as possible for the upcoming change – despite EES being an EU initiative,"" she added.Eurostar chief safety and stations officer Simon Lejeune said the government had supported an upgrade of its technology and facilities to meet the requirements. “Eurostar will be fully prepared and compliant by November, ensuring a smooth transition for all our passengers,"" he added.Emma Ward, chief operations officer for the Port of Dover, said the port was doing all it could to be ""ready with the facilities that will be used by French border officials operating the new system"".Each port is set to receive £3.5m of the funding, which is the first of its kind aimed at preventing EES-related delays.The government money will be used by Dover to help pay for a marina to be filled in, in order to provide extra space for coach passengers to be processed. Eurostar and Eurotunnel will use their share to pay for technology and staff training. Eurotunnel will add more kiosks if needed.All three have already invested tens of millions of pounds of their own money on preparing for the new system.Getlink, which manages Eurotunnel, started work two years ago to adapt to EES changes.""The focus has always been on customer satisfaction, delivering the most competitive crossing time and experience at the border for non-EU travellers,"" Yann Leriche, chief executive of Getlink, said."

Alison Smith, the Labour-led council's corporate services and equalities portfolio holder, said there was ""a great deal of digital poverty across Sunderland"" which the council was trying to tackle.She said: ""One in three of our residents do not have access to good digital tech and they need it for all sort of things including health, to access services.""It's really important the council supports that and provides the equipment they need.""Ms Smith added those who were in need of digital devices to take home should contact the council directly, or visit its headquarters at City Hall.A government spokesperson said a lack of access to technology was ""holding back communities and entrenching inequalities"".""This is unacceptable to this government and why we have made tackling digital exclusion in every corner of the country a priority.""They said the government was was working ""closely"" with charities and councils ""at pace to improve lives by maximising the potential of science and technology for everyone"".Addressing concerns over Universal Credit, it said that Jobcentres continued to provide help for claimants who had ""limited digital access"", and they could seek support from their work coach.

27,20-Aug-24,"Drone swarms could stop wildfires, researchers say",UK researchers hope swarms of up to 30 aircraft using AI could put out flames before they spread.,Technology,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/47ec/live/5c9ed1e0-5e58-11ef-b43e-6916dcba5cbf.jpg.webp,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg3e4pw294po,"Drones could soon be working together in swarms to put out flames before they become wildfires, UK researchers hope.A team of firefighters, scientists and engineers are working on a project they say will allow swarms of up to 30 autonomous planes to spot and extinguish fires by working collectively using artificial intelligence.Drones piloted by people are already used in firefighting, for example to detect hidden blazes and assess safety risks.The research is still in the test phase and has not been used on a wildfire, but the team claims it is the first to combine unpiloted drone technology with swarm engineering in the field of firefighting.The drones that researchers want to eventually use for firefighting are large twin-engined aircraft with a wingspan of 9.5m (31ft) and large water-carrying capacity.The BBC was invited to an airfield in Cornwall to watch a small-scale swarm trial using one of these along with two smaller test drones. A fire was lit in a bin and the aircraft worked together autonomously to spot it, according to researchers.The team hope the large drones' lifting power will allow them to carry water or retardant as options for putting out a blaze. In this early test the drones only descended towards the bin to mimic approaching the fire.The drones are already designed to fly without any intervention from remote pilots, even handling changes in flight conditions themselves.The next stage - swarm engineering - is about making many robots work together in real world applications, says Prof Sabine Hauert from the University of Bristol, one of the project partners.“When you look at birds and ants and bees, they can do beautiful, complex behaviours by co-ordinating and so we take inspiration from that to co-ordinate large numbers of robots,” she said.AI drones working individually and together in swarms open up the possibility of monitoring huge areas the size of the state of California, and detecting and responding to remote fires more quickly, she says.Similar to how a flock of birds can fly in a co-ordinated manner, a swarm can adapt to changes, so the drones can be deployed long-term, with no gaps in coverage if some have to drop out to refuel, researchers say.The twin-engine drones were developed by UK company Windracers, whose aircraft are also being tested in Antarctica to help experts forecast the impacts of climate change.While any real-world use of the technology would need to be approved by regulators, Nickolay Jelev, from Windracer says that the primary aim of the drone swarms would be to prevent fires from turning into infernos.He added that there would be scope to deter ""malicious fire starters"" too.“When you have 20 or 30 [drones] patrolling the skies it would act as a deterrent for people looking to start a fire."" Most wildfires in the UK are started by human activities, such as using barbecues in the open, the careless disposal of smoking materials or deliberate fires that then grow larger, according to the National Fire Chief’s Council (NFCC).But because of climate change the UK is seeing longer periods of dry, warm weather, creating the conditions for small fires to become much larger incidents, it says. The NFCC says that since 2021 there have been over 1,500 wildfires in England and Wales, according to new data from National Resilience, which coordinates the response to significant, serious or catastrophic incidents.If a swarm of drones can do the work at lower cost with no deaths, that would be a big win, said Prof Stefan Doerr, the head of Swansea University's Centre for Wildfire Research, who is independent from the project.But he’s not certain the technology is there yet, with questions remaining about the amount of water or retardant the drones would need to carry to be effective.“Fundamentally it is an exciting technology and will in the future for sure be part of the solution, but only part of the solution,” he said.The best part of the solution, he thinks, will be preventative: managing the landscape so that fires don’t become extreme in the first place."

A year earlier, he had founded Telegram and now runs the firm from Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) where he now lives.He holds citizenship of the UAE and France, but Russia has said it still regards him as a citizen. After he was arrested, Telegram said Mr Durov travelled in Europe frequently.In an interview with the conservative US media personality Tucker Carlson in April, Mr Durov said he would refuse certain requests from authorities to remove content from his platform.He said: ""Where we thought it would be crossing the line - it wouldn't be aligning with our values of freedom of speech and protecting people's private correspondence - we would ignore.""Telegram is one of the world's biggest social media and messaging platforms along with Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, TikTok and WeChat.In July, Mr Durov claimed that Telegram reached 950 million monthly active users. It is popular in Russia and Ukraine, while pro-democracy groups in Iran and Hong Kong also use it.Telegram does offer end to end encryption, which means the messages can only be read on the device that sends them and the device that receives them, but this is not the default setting for the user. The big difference between Telegram and similar services like WhatsApp is the size of groups you can be in on Telegram.WhatsApp limits group sizes to 1,000 users whereas up to 200,000 can be in a group on Telegram.The platform has faced criticism that disinformation can spread in these huge groups.Critics have argued the platform has seen the sharing of conspiracist, neo-Nazi, paedophilic, or terror-related content.In the UK, the app was scrutinised for hosting far-right channels that were instrumental in organising this month's violent disorder in English cities and cybersecurity experts say its moderation of extremist and illegal content is significantly weaker than other social media companies and messenger apps.Following Mr Durov's arrest, Telegram said its moderation ""is within industry standards and constantly improving"".It said it abides by European Union laws, including the Digital Services Act, which aims to ensure a safe and accountable online environment.""Almost a billion users globally use Telegram as means of communication and as a source of vital information,"" the app's statement read.""We’re awaiting a prompt resolution of this situation. Telegram is with you all.""In Wednesday's statement, the Paris prosecutors said Mr Durov was put under formal investigation over alleged offences that included:In France, being put under formal investigation does not imply guilt or necessarily result in a trial - but it indicates that judges consider there is enough of a case to proceed with an investigation.Elon Musk, the owner of X, has been defending Mr Durov for several days in a series of posts on his platform, formerly known as Twitter.He said moderation is a “propaganda word” for censorship, and called for Mr Durov's release.Chris Pavlovski, the founder of a controversial video-sharing app called Rumble, said he had fled Europe following Mr Durov’s detention.Earlier this week Edward Snowden, the American whistleblower who now lives in Russia after revealing extensive internet and phone surveillance by US intelligence, said on X that Mr Durov's arrest was ""an assault on the basic human rights of speech and association"". He added: ""I am surprised and deeply saddened that [French President Emmanuel] Macron has descended to the level of taking hostages as a means for gaining access to private communications. It lowers not only France, but the world.""After some details of the arrest had emerged, Vyacheslav Volodin - a prominent Russian politician and ally of Vladimir Putin - accused the US of being behind the arrest of Mr Durov.""Telegram is one of the few and at the same time the largest internet platforms over which the United States has no influence,"" he said in a post on the platform.President Macron posted on social media on Monday that he had seen ""false information"" regarding France following Mr Durov’s arrest, and added: ""This is in no way a political decision. It is up to the judges to decide."""

It later became clear that this content was not part of such an operation, Mr Zuckerberg said, and it should not have been temporarily taken down.Mr Zuckerberg did not give further detail about the actions he regretted during the pandemic.

32,21-Aug-24,London through the ages inspires Civilization VII,An eight-year wait for news on the next Civilization game is finally over.,Technology,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8f10/live/5e9f7a30-5fd4-11ef-b970-9f202720b57a.jpg.webp,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dp64e0r85o,"Fans of Civilization have been waiting almost a decade for the latest instalment of the cult video game series. Now it has been revealed that theme of time passing is pretty appropriate: the inspiration at the heart of Civilization VII, to be released in February, is how the capital of the UK has changed from the Roman era to now.And it all started with a map of Londinium - as London was known to the Romans.""Londinium looked like pretty much any frontier Roman town with an amphitheatre, baths, and a shaky bridge that crossed to the south side of the Thames,"" observed the game's lead developer Ed Beach, as he showed me the below map - used here courtesy of Encyclopaedia Britannica.""But I wanted to look at how this evolved, and how this changed as London grew and prospered."" It is the lessons from those changes that will lie at the heart of the new game.The Civilization series has sold 70 million copies since it began in 1991 - with the last edition released in 2016.The question of what direction developers Firaxis would take the next version of the game in has been a hot topic among fans.I include myself in that group - my brother first introduced me to Civ II on our PlayStation back in the 90s, and I was recently slightly horrified to discover I've spent more than 500 hours playing the sixth iteration of the series.For those that don't know, Civilization is at times more like a board game than a video game. You move units around a map, placing down cities and developing them, while fighting others to conquer their land for your own.Previous games in the series have locked players into playing as a particular leader and civilisation combination, such as Teddy Roosevelt and the United States, or Cleopatra and Egypt.But the developers say this isn't truly representative of how cities developed, where multiple different ruling groups leave their mark - just as they have with London.In the new game, a player might start off as the Romans, building their own Londinium in what it calls the antiquity era. But after progressing to the next stage - the exploration era in the game's lingo - players might become the Normans and build over what came before.The game's developers drew inspiration from Ludgate, the site of the west gate in the former London Wall, and dug up more old maps to see how the area had changed 1,000 years after the Romans left London.""London changes, and it grows, but you can see that core Roman encampment,"" Mr Beach said.The map, produced by Layers of London, part of the UK's Institute of Historical Research, shows the River Fleet still flows - but much of the Roman era buildings are no longer there.""It's all been built over by the buildings that you would expect in a medieval or renaissance era city,"" Mr Beach said.""We have inns, we have taverns, we still have religious buildings to the east side of the wall, but it's now St Paul's Cathedral, the very first version of it, before it got burned in the Fire of London. ""And we see that the river has been rerouted a little bit so that they can have a prison to hold some of those miscreants from the Middle Ages and keep them at bay.""This difference formed the foundation of the new game - building on top of what came before, to craft distinctly different eras.Finally, the developers jumped forward in time to the Victorian era, to see how the Ludgate area had changed once more.This map, reproduced with the permission of the National Library of Scotland, shows another significant set of changes - with the River Fleet now no longer visible after it was rerouted underground to be used for sewage in the mid-1800s.""Now the prison is totally replaced, the needs of the industrial revolution dictate we need a rail line in there, and Ludgate rail station is exactly on top of where the prison used to be,"" Mr Beach said.""All those buildings that used to support religious activity have pretty much been overtaken, except for St Paul's Cathedral.""This third stage of change - which the new game calls the modern era - solidified the concept for the developers.In London's example, gamers could play as the Romans, then the Normans, then as Britain - all the while building a growing England that goes beyond just the capital city.But while the big shift in style may be exciting for some, hardcore fans of the series might be concerned about just how different it is.It comes amid many other changes which will be meaningful to fans - though they won't make too much sense to people who haven't played the game.The game's developers tell me civilisations controlled by the computer will behave more intelligently. They list the seemingly endless changes like checking off a list - each civilisation has its own unique set of civics it can discover, units can now travel through rivers, and there are no more builders.There are expected changes - like a graphical overhaul that makes the game look modern - and unexpected ones too - like shifting the leaders you play as to include important historical figures that didn't lead their country, like Benjamin Franklin and Confucius.Meanwhile Hatshepsut, one of Egypt's historical female leaders, is now playable. The game's narrator - Game of Thrones and Star Wars actress Gwendoline Christie - adds a layer of gravitas to the visual upgrade.But not everything was directly taken from a fan's wishlist.Roads will still be built automatically by traders, which has long been a sore point for some players. There are some changes to the game's take on religion, but it still sounds to me like players will be micro-managing missionaries around the map.And big promises of fixing the AI are well-received, but without seeing the final product it's hard to be convinced.Moving between ages seems to be linked to crises - like barbarian invasions, civil wars and plagues - though exactly how this will work is unclear.Mr Beach said it develops a ""cool cycle that you go through three times in the game that we're releasing here at launch"" - a sentence I told him sounded suspiciously like Firaxis might be considering adding further cycles and empires in the future.He wouldn't be drawn on it.But one thing that seems certain is that by having what is effectively a big reset button between eras, no one player can storm ahead and take an unassailable lead at the start of each game, which will be music to fans' ears.We'll find out when the game comes next year."

In a statement at the time, the company said it was gathering feedback and insights from its partners in the news industry to develop the new platform.Others that have partnered with the AI firm include Time Magazine, the Financial Times and the Associated Press.AI chatbot technology is seen by many analysts as a key part of internet search engines in the future.Search engine giant Google has also been racing to add AI-powered tools to its products.While other AI companies are pursuing search products, Google remains by far the dominant player, claiming more than 90% of the global market.The changes to how search engines respond to queries - offering conversational paragraphs instead of directing users to links - have also raised alarm among news media firms, many of which rely on search traffic for audiences and revenue.Last year, the BBC said it was taking steps to prevent content on its websites from being used by OpenAI and other firms without permission.The blog post also said the BBC would explore opportunities offered by generative AI ""to deliver more value to our audiences and to society."""
34,22-Aug-24,Top US college says diversity slumps after affirmative action ban,MIT says intake of some minority groups has fallen from 25% to 16% in one year after a Supreme Court decision.,Technology,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c593/live/d29fa110-6166-11ef-b4f3-d9f05349be86.jpg.webp,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rxvd2z6ldo,"A prestigious US university has recorded a sharp fall in admissions from ""members of historically under-represented racial and ethnic groups,” following a Supreme Court decision to end affirmative action.The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) said 16% of its new intake identify as being black, Hispanic, Native American and/or Pacific islander - down 10 percentage points in one year. The Supreme Court ruled in 2023 that university admissions schemes promoting diversity violated the US Constitution's equal protection clause.Stu Schmill, MIT's dean of admissions, said he expected a fall and ""that is what happened"". He said he had ""no doubt that we left out many well-qualified, well-matched applicants... who would have excelled"".MIT is the first major university to publish data on intake since the court ruling.Sally Kornbluth, the president of MIT, said in an announcement that the new student intake was ""as always, outstanding"".""What it does not bring, as a consequence of last year's Supreme Court decision,"" she added, ""is the same degree of broad racial and ethnic diversity that the MIT community has worked together to achieve over the past several decades.""In recent years, around 25% of MIT's enrolling undergraduate students have identified as Black, Hispanic, and/or Native American and Pacific Islander, Mr Schmill added.Its figures show that this year, the percentage of black students enrolled dropped to 5% from 15%, and the percentage of Hispanic and Latino students dropped to 11% from 16%. White students make up 37% of the new class, compared with 38% last year, while the percentage of Asian American students rose to 47% from 40%. Asian-Americans are not included in MIT’s category of students “historically under-represented” in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects, which Mr Schmill has previously acknowledged to be a “crude standard”.The new admissions figures do not total 100% as some students identify as more than one race or ethnicity.More than 40% of the US population identifies as a race other than white, according to 2023 census data.In his latest comments, Mr Schmill said the intake in the year before the court decision had the largest proportion of under-represented minority students in the university's history. He added that MIT did not solicit race or ethnicity information from applicants this year, only from those who were enrolled.The university said the court decision had prompted it to expand recruitment and financial aid initiatives that prioritise low-income students from all backgrounds.Mr Schmill added that the university now looks for diversity through ""prospective fields of study and areas of research, extracurricular activities and accomplishments, as well as economic, geographic, and educational background"".Edward Blum, whose Students for Fair Admissions group brought the Supreme Court case, told The New York Times that ""every student admitted... will know that they were accepted only based upon their outstanding academic and extracurricular achievements, not the colour of their skin""."
35,23-Aug-24,When vets are scarce what can farmers do?,In Vietnam farmers are being encouraged to track the use of antibiotics and monitor disease.,Wales,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1cfc/live/5984cae0-44e1-11ef-96a8-e710c6bfc866.jpg.webp,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce58nvdg327o,"Quang Doan Hong is a busy person. The accountant, who lives with his family in Hưng Yên, Vietnam, also owns a farm with about 600 pigs.He’s had to learn quickly about pig health, from which vaccines are effective to when to use antibiotics.“When the weather changes, I give the pigs antibiotics,” Mr Hong says. In his experience, rapid changes between sunny and rainy weather make it necessary to administer antibiotics for respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases.Mr Hong has also had to learn which sources of information are reliable. He’s joined farming groups and done online research, although he’s realised that some information on Facebook, for instance, isn’t reliable. “I need to filter it,” he explains.As his operation has grown, Mr Hong has become reluctant to have veterinarians visit.He worries about the risk of disease transmission from people who come into contact with animals at many different sites. Some large farms require animal health workers to quarantine for several days before visiting.One thing that would be useful to Mr Hong is a hybrid source of information: something that combines the expertise of veterinarians with the convenience of digital access.These kinds of remote veterinary technologies are under development.The team behind Farm2Vet, a veterinary app for farmers, recently won the top prize from the Trinity Challenge, a charity tackling global health threats.The competition that Farm2Vet won focused on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) – the urgent global threat of our limited slate of antibiotic medicines becoming less effective as pathogens adapt.Farms where antibiotics are overused can become breeding grounds for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These bacteria then enter the food system and the environment, for instance due to animal waste. Some drug-resistant bacteria, like certain strains of E. coli, can spread between animals and humans.“Antibiotic misuse and overuse largely relates to a lack of understanding, a lack of support,” says Marc Mendelson, the director of the Trinity Challenge, who also heads the infectious diseases division at the University of Cape Town’s hospital.Veterinary antibiotics can be extremely cheap, Prof Mendelson says. “Some farmers probably don’t even know that they’re giving antibiotics, because it’s just in the feed.”Vietnamese regulations now require prescriptions for livestock antibiotics. But this requirement is relatively recent and difficult to monitor. In practice, antibiotics are dispensed without prescriptions, Pawin Padungtod acknowledges.Dr Padungtod, based in Hanoi, is the senior technical coordinator for the Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD), a unit of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).Helen Nguyen grew up in Vietnam and now lives in US, where she is an environmental engineer at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Both countries have issues with the way antibiotics are given to farm animals, she says.In the US, medically important antibiotics are used for livestock far more often than they’re used for human beings. And in Vietnam, Prof Nguyen says, only larger farmers can afford or access veterinarians.Prof Nguyen and the rest of the Farm2Vet team are seeking to address these issues in Vietnam by working with farmers, veterinarians, and agricultural suppliers to develop a smartphone app that provides reliable information on animal care.There would be an AI-powered chatbot to answer relatively simple questions, and connections to veterinarians in more complex cases.“The technology that we are trying to produce doesn’t replace vets,” according to Prof Nguyen. The aim is to allow veterinarians to expand their reach.She says that the challenge is not developing the technology, but accumulating the knowledge base.While there are Vietnamese-language veterinary publications, the amount of data required to feed the AI is likely to exceed what’s available in Vietnamese. Because so much of the published veterinary science is in English, it’s important to carefully translate and localise the information, even to the provincial level.It will be years before the app is ready. Prof Nguyen says that while the app will be free for farmers to use, eventually, for financial sustainability, the aim is to allow advertising and a paid farming certification programme.Also in Vietnam, the International Livestock Research Institute is designing a similarly named app, FarmVetCare. The idea is that using the app, farmers will report health abnormalities in livestock to a veterinarian. This is intended to help prevent and control animal diseases and diseases which can transfer between animals and humans.A different app is being piloted to extend the reach of the digital system for logging animal disease outbreaks through Vietnam’s Department of Animal Health. While the system now allows daily online reporting at the provincial level, the aim is to localise the reporting further, to be as close to the farm as possible.“The mobile application will then be very helpful because now they can start the reporting closer to the site of where the outbreak is,” Dr Padungtod says.Farmers may be reluctant to report veterinary diseases “because they don’t want to go bankrupt”, Prof Nguyen says. The Farm2Vet app would allow farmers to report veterinary illnesses anonymously, and the team would not provide identifiable data to anyone, according to Prof Nguyen.Prof Mendelson reckons such tools that can simplify the process of reporting, especially for subsistence farmers, are helpful.They may also help to prevent infection in the first place, which would cut down on the need for precious antibiotics. “The biggest bang for buck is in preventing infection – and not only in humans, but in in livestock,” Prof Mendelson says.He comments that governments could encourage prevention by making vaccination more accessible. And farmers could reduce the chances of infection by giving farm animals more space. Prof Mendelson says, “Intensive livestock farming increases stress on animals. It increases illness and risks.”While the tech world is full of well-meaning apps that end up being little used, Mr Hong, the pig farmer, has expressed interest. He appreciates the practicality and user-friendliness of apps. “If available, I would like to use them,” he says."

37,16-Aug-24,Fortnite app returns to iPhones - but only in the EU,The boss of the game's publisher says he hopes to bring it to UK iPhones in 2025.,Technology,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9844/live/9f697060-5bcf-11ef-99f7-3dae98c58eb1.jpg.webp,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70j5rx72yvo,"Fortnite, one of the world's biggest video games, is available as an iPhone app for the first time in four years.However, it will only be available to players in the European Union.This is because EU law requires Apple to allow third-party app stores on its devices - other parts of the world do not have comparable legislation.The game was removed from the App Store in 2020 following a payments row between Apple and Epic.Users will have to install an alternative app store on to their phones in order to download the game.One of these alternative shopfronts is the newly-launched Epic Games Store, which is also available on Google Android devices for the first time.Epic admits the process is ""lengthy"" and blames Apple and Google for ""introducing intentionally poor-quality install experiences laden by multiple steps, confusing device settings, and scare screens.""Apple said in a statement that new EU law ""required us to enable new capabilities for developers in the EU, and we have worked to make them as easy as possible for users while also trying to protect their privacy and security.""The BBC has approached Google for comment.It comes as Fortnite launches its new season based around Marvel's Doctor Doom.New EU legislation, called the Digital Markets Act, came into force in March, which means that Apple has to allow alternative app stores on its devices. However, those laws do not exist in other parts of the world, where apps can only be downloaded from Apple's official App Store. ""Fortnite has been freed on iOS in Europe, thanks to the Digital Markets Act"", Epic boss Tim Sweeney said on X.""Apple continues to block Fortnite from a billion players in the rest of the world, and the battle rages on to restore free market competition.""Apple says this is mainly for security reasons.However, Epic argues that it means Apple has a monopoly and can charge high rates - up to 30% commission on purchases - to app developers.A similar commission is charged by Google when apps are downloaded through its Google Play store.However, Google does allow alternative app stores on its Android devices.Android users could already download the Fortnite app directly from Epic Games on to their phones.Fortnite is free to play, but makes money by charging players for in-game purchases for items such as new skins or weapons.It was removed from Apple and Google's app stores in 2020 after Epic Games stopped paying the commission.Currently, UK iPhone users cannot download Fortnite, however they can play on a browser.The Guardian reports Epic Games wants to bring the Fortnite app back to UK iPhones in late 2025.“Unless Apple and Google manage to lobby the UK government that they should be able to continue blocking competition, we should be able to move on that by the end of next year,” Tim Sweeney told them.New competition law was passed in May, which could pave the way for alternative app stores on iPhones.""The fight is far from over, but this is tangible progress for developers and consumers who can begin to benefit from competition and choice,” Mr Sweeney said in a press release.Epic Games has also made its games Rocket League Sideswipe and Fall Guys available on its new app store."

He was found to be offering to sell access to the systems and selling stolen databases containing private information like Social Security Numbers to other cyber criminals on the darknet. The darknet is a portion of the internet only accessible through specialist software that hides a browser’s identity. There are many darknet marketplaces where cyber criminals sell stolen data or access to compromised IT systems.Kipf sold to international buyers, including individuals from Algeria, Russia and Ukraine, the court was reportedly told.“This scheme was a cynical and destructive effort, based in part on the inexcusable goal of avoiding his child support obligations,” said Carlton S. Shier, IV, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky.Under federal law, Kipf must serve 85 percent of his prison sentence and will be under the supervision of the U.S. Probation Office for three years.The damage to governmental and corporate computer systems and his failure to pay his child support obligations amounted to a total of $195,758.65."

It benefits those wanting to avoid a lengthy trial, but means evidence would not be put in front of a jury.Jamie Cartwright, partner at the law firm Charles Russell Speechlys, suggested Disney's change of heart was motivated by the ""adverse publicity"" its initial approach had generated.""In attempting to push the claim into a confidential setting on what were very tenuous grounds, it succeeded only in creating the very publicity and attention it likely wanted to avoid,"" he told the BBC.Mr Piccolo and his wife, Dr Kanokporn Tangsuan, ate a meal at Raglan Road, an Ireland-themed pub located at the Disney Springs site, in Orlando, but operated by an independent company. He alleges that the restaurant did not take enough care over his wife's severe allergies to dairy and nuts, despite being repeatedly told about them.She died in hospital later that day.According to the legal filing, her death was confirmed by a medical examiner ""as a result of anaphylaxis due to elevated levels of dairy and nut in her system.""Mr Piccolo is suing Disney for a sum in excess of $50,000 (£38,400), in addition to other damages relating to suffering, loss of income, and medical and legal costs.Disney has argued it had no control over the management and operation of the restaurant.Lawyers for Mr Piccolo had said Disney's argument that the lawsuit should not be heard in court ""borders on the surreal."" It is not known whether Disney would have been successful had a judge ruled on its arbitration claim. Disney had argued that the legal circumstances surrounding the case were unique.But legal experts told the BBC they had been ""pushing the envelope of contract law"".""Disney’s argument that accepting their terms and conditions for one product covers all interactions with that company is novel and potentially far-reaching,"" Ernest Aduwa, partner at Stokoe Partnership Solicitors, who are not involved in the proceedings, said.Meanwhile, Jibreel Tramboo, barrister at Church Court Chambers, said the terms in the Disney+ trial were a ""weak argument for Disney to rely on"".Disney says it is in the process of submitting a filing to the court to withdraw its call for arbitration.Additional reporting by Graham Fraser"

48,16-Aug-24,Is this the end for the magnetic stripe?,Once common on tickets and cardkeys the magnetic stripe is being phased out.,Nottingham,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/db79/live/da0e18a0-5b21-11ef-8f0f-0577398c3339.jpg.webp,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51yd4j4lnvo,"As he slipped the key card into the reader on his hotel room door and tried the handle - to no avail - he realised what he had done.For years, Steven Murdoch, a security researcher at University College London, had taken care not to put tickets or cards with magnetic stripes in his pocket next to his smartphone. This is because the magnets in smartphones are sometimes strong enough to wipe the data on magnetic stripes.But so-called magstripe hotel key cards are rare these days, increasingly superseded by contactless cards with radio frequency identification (RFID) chips inside them.As such, during his hotel visit in January this year, Prof Murdoch forgot to take precautions and, he concludes, wiped his room key – having used it only once.“I should have known better, this is the sort of thing I do know about,” he says. Upon arriving back at reception, he realised he was not alone.“There was a queue of people with exactly the same problem as me,” he recalls.The magnetic stripe was invented by an IBM engineer in the 1960s – his wife was instrumental in the process as it was she who suggested melting a strip of magnetic tape onto a card using a clothes iron.In the decades since, magstripes have been used on bank cards, rail tickets, IDs and even cards containing medical information, to set up hospital machines.But that murky brown strip of plastic usually made with polluting heavy metals may not be around for much longer. From this year onwards, for instance, Mastercard will not require banks to put a magnetic stripe on debit and credit cards.For ticketing, new technologies including printable barcodes and reusable contactless cards are considered more environmentally friendly and potentially more convenient. You also can’t wipe them by accidentally putting them too close to your iPhone.There are, broadly, two kinds of magnetic stripe, called HiCo and LoCo. The latter is cheaper, less durable, and more susceptible to disruption from magnets, says Lee Minter, head of global operations at Nagels, which makes magstripe tickets and other products. Recently, the company investigated reports from a customer who said multiple magstripe tickets they had bought had got corrupted.Mr Minter says he can’t be 100% sure but he and his colleagues are of the opinion that it was caused by part of a circular magnet within the customer’s iPhone.“It matched perfectly to the area which had been wiped,” he says.In response, Apple says: ""Smartphones and other items contain magnets or components that may have a risk of demagnetizing low coercivity cards. To prevent this from happening, users should keep these cards stored separately.""While such disruption remains relatively rare, Mr Minter says that the magnetic stripe is declining in popularity either way. Of the five billion tickets Nagels prints every year, less than one-fifth now have magnetic stripes, he estimates.Mr Minter is keen to stress the potential of thermally printed paper tickets, much like receipts, which are now being used in trials at multiple rail stations around the UK. These come with a QR code that can be used on ticket barrier scanners. There is a separate code on the back to stop people forging tickets.Stuart Taylor, head of commercial development at Northern, a train operator, says 70% of his firm’s customers now buy digital tickets and that Northern could axe the familiar orange-trimmed, magstripe-sporting versions in just five years’ time.“There is a clear environmental benefit,” says Mr Taylor. “Times change, I guess.”Northern is now trialling the thermally printed paper tickets made by Nagels as an alternative. There have been some issues with printer jams and the tickets getting stuck in ticketing machines but these problems have largely been addressed, says Mr Taylor.He emphasises that there are no plans to withdraw paper tickets, nor to cut any staff involved in ticket sales.Are there any benefits to keeping magstripe cards or tokens around? “No,” says Sue Walnut, product director for intelligent transportation systems at Vix Technology, bluntly. She argues there are now so many different ways of validating a rail ticket - for example, QR codes presented on phone screens, tickets printed at home, prepaid contactless cards - that there is less need to retain magstripe technology than ever before.But magstripe tickets and entry cards do slot conveniently into credit card holders in wallets and purses. The new paper tickets being trialled by Northern and other rail firms are larger. “They are a bit unwieldy and cumbersome,” says Ms Walnut.Magstripe has hung around for so long partly because it is relatively cheap and the specifications for reading machines were put in place many decades ago, says Stephen Cranfield at Barnes International, which makes equipment for magnetic stripe testing.“If you took your card today and used it in a magstripe reader from 1970, it would still be able to read it,” he says.His firm has worked on a variety of systems - including one designed to allow kidney failure patients to use a magstripe card for setting up their dialysis machine.Despite the ubiquity of dark brown or black magstripes, they can actually come in a whole range of colours. “It’s quite popular in China, actually – gold stripes,” explains Mr Cranfield.But now that US banks are finally switching to chip and PIN cards, the market for magstripe is clearly dwindling.Prof Murdoch says although magstripe technology is extremely well established, it is “inevitable” that it will gradually disappear. One downside to that, he suggests, is that magnetic stripe failures and fraud are currently well understood. Newer technologies, while in theory more secure, may also be more complex - and therefore exploitable by criminals using novel methods.Sometimes, members of the public contact Prof Murdoch when they are having trouble proving to their bank that they have been the victim of fraud.“If the transaction was done by magstripe, then it’s a very easy argument to say someone copied it,” says Prof Murdoch as he points out the irony. “But if the transaction was one of the more secure methods - then it’s much harder.”"

We are only at BlackHat to be lampshade holders?"" asked executive advisor Olivia Rose in a LinkedIn post that eventually prompted Mr Arora’s apology.""Shame on you - just shame"", she wrote.The image of the women was taken by LinkedIn user Sean Juroviesky who described the scene as ""sexist"".""What the hell Palo Alto Networks is it 1960?"", he commented.One Reddit user, who claimed to have been at the event, said they left early as it was ""creepy"" and ""gross"".The idea for the outfits seems to have been inspired by the so-called ""booth babes"" of the early days of the Consumer Electronics Show, in the 1960s, where women were hired as hostesses at what were mostly male-attended events.By the 1990s the use of what were often scantily-clad women in this way started facing a backlash, and by the 2010s it had largely disappeared.But the male dominance of the tech industry has not gone away - nor have concerns that women are being shut out or treated in sexist ways.When it shut unexpectedly earlier this year, the tech network Women Who Code said its vision of a tech industry ""where diverse women and historically excluded people thrive at every level is not fulfilled"".One of the few female tech CEO’s Bumble’s Lidiane Jones told the BBC this year it was ""still not an equitable journey for women today"" in the industry."
50,7 days ago,EE tells parents: don't give under-11s smartphones,The mobile phone network recommends parents buy under-11s phones that can only text or call.,West Yorkshire,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/badd/live/fc912390-62ce-11ef-b1a0-5377375b57ce.jpg.webp,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gvpy3yz1yo,"One of the UK's largest mobile network providers is advising parents not to give primary school-aged children their own smartphone.EE, which is owned by BT, said it aims to improve children's ""digital wellbeing"" after receiving increasing requests for guidance from parents.It said that under-11s should be given ""non-smart"" devices that have similar capabilities as old brick phones.The recommendation - announced for the start of the new school year - comes amid growing concern about the effects of smartphone and internet usage on children's mental health and behaviour.Access to the internet can support young people's education and social activities, as well as helping parents keep track of their whereabouts. But, some experts warn it contributes to shorter attention spans, exposes children to harmful content, and displaces other activities such as playing outside or talking to friends.EE said under-11s should be given phones that can be used to text and make calls, but without access to the internet or social media apps like TikTok and Youtube.The firm, which is marketing a phone with limited capabilities for children, suggests parents use apps and settings to monitor older children's internet usage.Its corporate affairs director Mat Sears said EE wanted to help parents and caregivers ""make the best choices for their children"".He told the BBC: ""Under-11s we feel should not be given access to smartphones. They don't need the usage of a smartphone and, actually, a feature phone - or a dumb phone, as some people call them - is more suitable.""Almost a quarter of five-to-seven-year-olds now have their own smartphone, recent research from the telecoms regulator Ofcom found.By age 11, when children typically transfer to secondary school, almost all have a phone of some kind, it says.Ofcom described its research, published earlier this year, as a ""wake-up call"" after it found over half of under-13s were using social media, despite most of the big platforms having rules requiring that users are over 13.Mr Sears said he believed smartphones were appropriate for children aged between 11 and 13 - but not access to social media. For 13-to-16-year-olds, he advised parents to exercise ""care and attention"" over which social media apps they download.""We think it's absolutely fine and okay for social media to be used [by over-13s] but various parental controls and privacy settings should be put in place, as well as screen locks for the amount of time that is being placed on these various social media sites.""Clare Fernyhough, co-founder of grassroots campaign group Smartphone Free Childhood, welcomed EE’s new guidance.“It’s a positive move to get parents to question this norm that ‘yeah I’ll just get them a smart phone',"" she said.Ms Fernyhough continued: “I would challenge the idea all children need a phone.“[But] if a child needs a phone at all, absolutely it should be a simple phone. They are far less addictive.“The way smartphones are, they are adult devices, they are not safe for children.""She would like to see a mechanism introduced for verifying a person’s age on the device itself, not just when signing up to access content, as is the case now.Recent government legislation aims to ensure children are not exposed to harmful online content, such as material that promotes suicide and self-harm, eating disorders, and violent content. The Online Safety Act places more responsibility on technology platforms, introducing a legal duty of care towards their users.But the Act does not come into force until 2025, and critics, including Ms Fernyhough, say while it is a step in the right direction it does not go far enough to protect young people.Some other countries, including France, Italy and the Netherlands, have banned the use of smartphones in schools.Last year, China's regulator proposed limiting daily screen time for children up to the age of 18.The UK's Commons education committee said in May that the government should consider a total ban on smartphones for under-16s.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said in July that he does not support ""simply banning"" phones for under-16s, but that the government needed to ""look again"" at what content children were accessing online.Last year, parents from eight primary schools in County Wicklow, Ireland, agreed not to give their children smartphones before they went to secondary school to relieve the peer pressure from other children already having access."
