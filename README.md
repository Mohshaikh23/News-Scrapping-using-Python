# BBC Technology News Scraper

This project scrapes BBC's website for news articles related to "Technology" and extracts useful information such as article titles, subtitles, publication times, and content.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main scripts:

1. **app.py** - This script scrapes the BBC website for technology news articles and saves the extracted data into a CSV file.
2. **collector.py** - This script takes the CSV file generated by `app.py`, visits each link in the file, and extracts the full article content, saving the updated data into a new CSV file.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip
- Google Chrome
- Chrome WebDriver (ensure that it matches your version of Chrome)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohshaikh23/News-Scrapping-using-Python.git
```

### Install Required Python Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Scrape BBC Technology News

Run `app.py` to scrape the BBC website for technology news articles. This script will:

1. Search the BBC website for articles related to "Technology."
2. Navigate through multiple pages of search results.
3. Save the extracted data into a CSV file called `Data.csv`.

```bash
python app.py
```

### Step 2: Extract Full Article Content

Run `collector.py` to visit each link in the `Data.csv` file and extract the full article content. This script will:

1. Load the `Data.csv` file.
2. Visit each article link.
3. Extract the full content of the article.
4. Save the updated data into a new CSV file called `Updated_Data.csv`.

```bash
python collector.py
```

## Output

- **Data.csv**: Contains the initial scraped data (titles, subtitles, publication times, etc.).
- **Updated_Data.csv**: Contains the full article content along with the initial scraped data.

## Notes

- Ensure that Chrome WebDriver is installed and that its path is included in your system's PATH variable.
- You may need to adjust the sleep times in the scripts depending on your internet speed and the responsiveness of the BBC website.
